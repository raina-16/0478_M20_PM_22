 Snazzy Autos customers buying a new car can trade in an old car. Offers from Rs 10000 to Rs 1.00 lakh can be made for an old car. If an old car is not traded in, then a discount of 5% is taken off the price of the new car and any optional extras. In addition, repeat customers are offered a discount of 10% off any optional extras and 10% off the price of the new car before trade-in.
Customers can either pay for the new car in full or make monthly payments over several years.
Write and test a program or programs for the car buying service.
• Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data; data must be validated on entry.
• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.
• All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested. Task 1 – Calculate the price
Customers choose the model of car and select any optional extras required. Only valid choices can be accepted for the model and the extras. The customer is asked if they are an existing customer and if they have an old car to trade in. If the customer trades in an old car the amount offered by Snazzy Autos is entered. The price of the new car including model and extras is displayed. Any discount or trade-in amounts are displayed and the total price to pay is calculated and displayed.
Task 2 – Calculate the payment(s)
Extend Task 1 to display these payment methods:
• full amount paid now customer receives cashback of 1% on the total price
• equal monthly payments are made over four years with no extra charge
• the total price is increased by 5%; equal monthly payments are made over seven years.
For each payment method display: the total amount to pay, the amount of each payment, the number of payments and cashback where appropriate.
Task 3 – New full amount payment offer
Extend Task 2 to offer customers who decide to pay the full amount now either the 1% cashback or the chosen optional extras free. Customers are shown the offer that is the best value first and the other as an alternative. Details of each offer must be displayed in full.
